# Backlog

This backlog collects high-value feature ideas for `aws-safe-mcp`. It is a
planning aid, not a commitment to build every item in order.

## Evaluation Rules

Prefer features that:

- Preserve the read-only, bounded, redacted tool model.
- Help developers investigate failures, permissions, and dependencies.
- Reuse the dependency-tool contract where a graph is useful.
- Can be verified against local fixtures in `../aws-sdk-mcp-tf`.
- Work against Floci when practical, and MiniStack when Floci lacks service
  support.

Avoid features that:

- Add raw AWS SDK passthrough.
- Read S3 object bodies, DynamoDB items, secret values, or decrypted KMS data.
- Return full policy documents or full state machine definitions.
- Expand scope without a clear diagnostic workflow.

## Feature Candidates

### Deep Diagnostic Workflows

Ordered by estimated feature size, smallest first. Each item accounts for the
current public tool surface in `src/aws_safe_mcp/server.py` and
`src/aws_safe_mcp/tools/*`; scopes focus on new diagnostic value beyond existing
single-resource summaries, dependency graphs, and permission checks.

All planned feature candidates have been implemented.

## Suggested Order

Use the feature candidate order above.
